Software flaw detection using multimodal deep learning models has been demonstrated as a very competitive approach on benchmark problems. In this work, we demonstrate that even better performance can be achieved using neural architecture search (NAS) combined with multimodal learning models. We adapt a NAS framework aimed at investigating image classification to the problem of software flaw detection and demonstrate improved results on the Juliet Test Suite, a popular benchmarking data set for measuring performance of machine learning models in this problem domain.
