I'm currently a PhD Student in ReDAS (Reasoning and Data Analytics for Security) lab @ University of Houston. My Ph.D. advisor is [Rakesh M. Verma](http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~rmverma/). I'm interested in software security, cybersecurity, and machine learning. I received both my bachelor and master degree in Computer Science from University of Houston in 2017 and 2019.
